    <h1>Jiabao Su <br>
        Project 3 <br>
        IGME 235-04</h1>

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>My goals for this project was to be able to create a nearly sellable game with the tools given to us.
        At first I didn't really understand JavaScript and Pixijs as much so Through doing this project,
        I wanted to be able to solidify my undestanding of JavaScript. Game wise, my goals were pretty simple.
        Make a simple and smooth game experience that exceeds the circle blast homework. I also
        wanted to make this game portfolio worthy and something that can show other people my skills.
    </p>

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>When first told about project 3, I already knew that I wanted to make a shmup/bullet hell/space invaders
        kind of game. This type of game is has simple mechanics but can still feel fun to play. Even before I did the cirlce 
        blast hw I already had an idea. Since I don't think that I am a creative person, it was hard to come up 
        with an original game idea. I like to find inspiration from other games and build my own version of it. That was kind 
        of the planning process for this project.
    </p>
    <p>The circle blast hw helped a lot in starting my code. I also used Dower Chin's tutorial series to get m started.
        I started with the simple stuff first like building the scene, then adding geometry to the scene. After that I started playing around
        with what I can do to the geometry. My first focus was creating the player. I started off with the simple code like movement 
        and then slowly implemented more mechanics like shooting. 
    </p>
    <p>After I was satisfied with the player I moved on to the objects and enemies the player would need to avoid.
        I decided to use asteroids as it relates to my space theme. Like those top down shmups, I programmed asteroids to
        come down from the top of the screen at random locations at certain intervals. The enemy space shapes were programmed 
        similarly but I wanted the enemies to be able to shoot and hit the player. This wasn't particularly hard as I already programmed
        the player to shoot so I use the same sort of program and created a function in the enemy class to allow the enemies to fire bullets.
    </p>

    <p>Once the player and the enemies are able to do what they need to do, the third major step is to make them interact with eachother.
        First was making the sprites and bullets able to collide with eachother. Since the cirlce blast hw already had a collision function, I reused it 
        in my code. Another function I reused form circle blast was the clamp method to keep the player within the scene. 
    </p>

    <p>At this point, we have a playable game. Now it's just time to polish the game and make it feel more like a game. I started by implementing
        the score system and the life system. Then I started to add scaling difficulty since the game was pretty easy and gets
        repetitive. I thought about how I would make the game harder as the game went on and ultimately I decided on scaling the difficulty
        based on the score. As the score gets higher I would make the asteroids/enemies spawn more often, move faster, move diagonally, and made
        the enemies shoot more bullets. Lastly in this process, I added a start and game over scene that both will lead back to the game scene.
        Now we have a game in our hands.
    </p>
    <p>lastly, I implented powerups like I said I would in my proposal. The three powerups I decided on having were: Increase shoot speed,
        shoot 2 additional bullets forward, and shoot two additional bullets that go diagonally from the player. I implemented them similarly to the enemies.
        I made their spawn chance really low as these powerups do actually help a lot. I decided to make the bullet powerups as a short timed buff as they 
        were too good. I have now implemented all the mechanics of the game. 
    </p>
    <p>The final process was adding in the assets and adding CSS to the cite. I found a really good asset pack that has pretty much everything I needed.
        I replaced everything with the assets and added sound and animations to spice up the game. Sound really does make a difference. Finally I finished up
        the css of the page to make it appealing and relevent to the theme. At this point everything is pretty much done and ready. Now it's time to finish up
        writing this document.
    </p>

    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <h3>A.Functional</h3>
    <p>The fully utilized pixijs for the game and some DOM for outside the game area. The game fully works with no errors and is simple and easy to use.</p>
    
    <h3>B.Design & Interaction</h3>
    <p>I used an asset pack for the most of the visuals. Game uses consistent design and fits the theme. Elements are legible and readable. Shouldn't be too hard 
        to figure out whats going on on the page. Not nearly responsive but can still play on a small screen size.
    </p>

    <h3>C.Media</h3>
    <p>Images are properly optimized and are preloaded. Sound is used. Assets are different than what were used in class</p>

    <h3>D.HTML/CSS</h3>
    <p>HTML/CSS are validated and an external style sheet is used. Semantic structure is sorta present.</p>

    <h3>E.Code Conventions</h3>
    <p>Code utilizes the correct variable type. Dom traversal is used correctly. Multiple ES6 classes are implemented.
        Code is grouped into functions that are all commented and labeled appropriately. Multiple JavaScript files are used to group
        chunks of code. Code could be better organized.
    </p>

    <h2>Sources</h2>
    <p>Mostly all the assets including sounds were from Kenney Vleugels Space Shooter Redux asset pack.<br>
    link can be found <a href="https://www.kenney.nl/">here</a> <br>
    For the space background and the animation spritesheet I forgot to save where I got it from but I got it somewhere on the internet.
    Im sure you can reverse google search it and find the source. Im too lazy to go back to find it.
</p>

    <h2>Final Notes</h2>
    <p>Overall I am pretty happy with my game. In the limited time I had and balancing 3 other projects I think I did pretty well.
        Theres a lot more I Could do to make this game even better. On the same note, I wasn't able to implement a lot of things I had in mind
        like a shield, more complicated movements, and more enemy types. I might keep updating this game when I have some free time 
        and see how far I can go. Lastly, I want to thank you professor for a great semester. You were a really great help and you made 
        this class really interested. I was never into web design before this but you were able to spark my interest in this subject. We really do 
        appreciate what you have done for us. I hope the best for your future and maybe I'll be seeing you again in the future. Enjoy your well deserved
        winter break. This is goodbye for now :virtual wave:.
